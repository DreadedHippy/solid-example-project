# Solid JS Example project
Simple e-commerce project made with solid-js and tailwind CSS

## Running the project
### Prerequisites
- You must have [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) installed globally

### Instructions
- Clone the git repo
- Navigate to the cloned directory
- In the terminal run `npm i` to install all required dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server on http://localhost:3000
- Run `json-server -w -p 4000 ./data/db.json` to run the fake JSON Rest API on port 4000
- Enjoy ðŸ’«

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```
